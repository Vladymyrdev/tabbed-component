# Description

For this task, a tabbed component is implemented that includes a numbered tabbed list. The component has a numbered listing of the most recent Guardian content chosen from three sections of the site: UK News, Football and Travel. Each of these sections has represented by a tab. Data is fetching asynchronously from Guardian Content API. It is doing this on the client-side. This solution runs in the browser alone with no runtime server-side requirements. This web application implements the component approach inherent in React.js. This allows you to add new objects without changing the existing code. When executing asynchronous requests, error handling is provided if the request is not successful. While the data is being received, the download loader executed in pure css is displayed to the user. The application does not use UI libraries such as antd, material ui and others.
